# ContextCraft

So... funny story. 🎭

This project started with me thinking "Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have a simple tool to copy-paste prompts between local files and AI tools?" You know, something quick and dirty. Maybe a weekend project.

*Several caffeine-fueled coding sessions (and consuming millions of gemini 2.5 pro tokens) later...*

I somehow ended up building this full-blown Electron app

## What it Actually Does

* 📁 Manages your local project folders (because who doesn't need ANOTHER file manager?)
* 🤖 Chats with AI using your code as context (it's like giving your code a voice, but less skynet-y)
* ⚙️ Configures different LLM providers (because choosing one is too mainstream)
* 🔒 Securely stores your API keys (unlike that one time you accidentally pushed them to GitHub)
* 💾 Saves your settings (because nobody likes repeating themselves)

## Tech Stack

Built with:
* Electron (because web browsers are too mainstream)
* React + TypeScript (because JavaScript alone wasn't complicated enough)
* SQLite3 (for when JSON just doesn't cut it)
* A bunch of other cool stuff you can find in package.json

## Getting Started

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd contextcraft
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   (Grab a coffee, this might take a while...)

3. Run it:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Future Plans

* Better MCP support (because apparently, I love making things more complex)
* Enhanced thinking mode handling
* Whatever else the community throws at me via PRs 🎯

## Contributing

Found this useful? Feel free to throw a PR my way!

## To Do

- [ ] Actually write those MCP improvements
- [ ] Make the thinking mode smarter (it's currently in its teenage years)
- [ ] Keep pretending this was the plan all along

## License

Take it. Use it. Love it. Just don't blame me if it becomes sentient.

*Remember: This project is like life - it didn't turn out exactly as planned, but we're rolling with it anyway!* 🎢
