# ContextCraft

**Version:** 0.1.0

## Description

ContextCraft is a desktop application designed to help developers analyze their codebase and interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) using their code as context. Built with Electron, React, and TypeScript.

## Features

*   **Project Management:** Select and manage local project folders.
*   **Code Analysis:** Browse the file tree of your selected projects.
*   **LLM Interaction:** Chat with LLMs, leveraging your codebase for context-aware responses.
*   **Configuration:** Configure settings for different LLM providers.
*   **Secure Storage:** Securely stores sensitive information like API keys using `keytar`.
*   **Persistent Settings:** Uses `electron-store` for saving application settings and `sqlite3` for structured data.

## Technologies Used

*   **Framework:** Electron
*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
*   **Styling:** CSS (App.css, index.css)
*   **State Management:** React Context (likely, based on `ThemeContext.tsx`)
*   **Backend (Electron Main Process):** Node.js, TypeScript
*   **Storage:** SQLite3, Electron Store
*   **Security:** Keytar
*   **Build Tool:** Vite, Electron Builder
*   **Linting:** ESLint

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (Check `package.json` for specific engine requirements if any)
*   npm (or yarn/pnpm)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd contextcraft
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *This will also install native dependencies required for Electron using `electron-builder install-app-deps`.*

### Running the Application (Development)

To run the application in development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building and Packaging

1.  **Build Frontend & Electron Main/Preload:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run build:electron
    ```
    *Alternatively, `npm run package` runs these steps implicitly.*

2.  **Package the Application:**
    To package the application for your current platform:
    ```bash
    npm run package
    ```
    *This will create distributable installers/packages in the `dist` directory (or as configured in `electron-builder`).*
